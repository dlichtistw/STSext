# STSext
Firefox extension for the use on [StellwerkSim.de][1].

This was started in response to [this forum post][2] and some other which I can't find.

It is a proof of concept, work in progress at best. Use at your own risk.

More ideas may or may not get added. Do not expect active development. If you find a bug, fix it.

## Installation
Download the packaged and signed `sts_extensions-*.xpi` file and install it in your browser.
